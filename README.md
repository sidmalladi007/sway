# Sway
Mobile to Cloud Project [2016]
by Sid Malladi

Sway is a frictionless rewards platform that bridges the digital divide between users and small businesses.

Typically, large corporations and chains have the resources and technical know-how to implement loyalty cards to engage customers with exciting deals and offers to boost retention. But small pop and pop stores are left out of the picture. With Sway, small business owners can implement a "digital punch card" system in just a few minutes! They set simple incentive rules, such as - "Buy 9 coffees and get the 10th one free (up to a value of $5)". When customers subscribe to their rewards program through Sway, the app keeps track of purchases, and once that 10th coffee is purchased, Sway reimburses the customer up to a value of $5, and invoices business for catering to their customer retention needs. Through rich dashboards and seamless experience, Sway removes the barriers for small businesses to have an incredible digital relationship with their customers, all without having to purchase expensive hardware and integrations!
